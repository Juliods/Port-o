This program was made on an evening with the intent to train with java.
Inittially there were meant to be two classes, an door and another one which would controll it.
However my ability to replicate this plan was limited by my lack of understanding of what i was doing.

The intent of the program is to controll an gate and allow an user to open or close the gate using java.
